All four datasets have the same averages, correlations, and regression lines, but the plots show one is a straight line, another is curved, and others are shaped by outliers.\nThe problem is that if we only look at numbers, we may miss these hidden patterns and make wrong conclusions.\nSolution: Always graph the data before and after running models.
