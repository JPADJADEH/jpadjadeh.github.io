## Introduction

I downloaded ten recent documents from the Foreign Relations Committee using the govinfo.gov API through the `govtdata01.R` script and analyzed the data collection challenges.

## Difficulties Encountered

**1. Parameter Usage**

I initially overlooked the script's parameter feature (e.g., `1:10`) that controls download quantity and manually stopped the process to avoid excess downloads.

**2. File Identification**

Downloaded PDFs used generic naming (`govfiles_1.pdf`) making it hard to identify documents without opening them.

**3. Processing Speed**

Built-in delays (1-3 seconds between downloads) slowed the process, though necessary to avoid server issues.

## Data Usability

**Moderately Usable**

The PDFs contain complete legislative text but require extraction for analysis. No automatic metadata capture means document details must be extracted manually from each file.

## Improvements

1.  **Better file naming** - Extract titles/bill numbers for descriptive filenames
2.  **Create metadata CSV** - Automatically capture document ID, title, date, and sponsor during download
3.  **Text extraction** - Convert PDFs to searchable text for bulk analysis
4.  **Progress tracking** - Show download status and completion estimates

## Conclusion

The scraping process successfully downloaded required documents. Main challenge was my initial failure to use the built-in controls. Data is usable but would benefit from automatic metadata extraction and better file organization for easier analysis.
