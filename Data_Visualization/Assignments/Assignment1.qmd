# Assignment 1

## Analyzing Anscombe’s Plots

Anscombe’s Quartet teaches us that data can look the same in numbers but tell very different stories when you make a graph.  
All four datasets have the same averages, correlations, and regression lines, but the plots show one is a straight line, another is curved, and others are shaped by outliers.  

**Lesson:** If we only look at numbers, we may miss hidden patterns and draw wrong conclusions.  

Always graph the data before and after running models. Simple plots like scatterplots can reveal issues such as:  
- Outliers  
- Non-linear trends  
- Unusual points

## Critique of the Plot (Lessons from Nathan Yau)

This plot tries to show too many things at once—different contrasts, shapes, colors, and line styles—making it cluttered and hard to read.  

As Nathan Yau emphasizes, **a good visualization should highlight the story clearly**, but here the message is buried under visual noise.  

Problems in the plot:  
- Long inline labels crowd the chart.  
- The zero line (a key reference) is not emphasized enough.  

**Cleaner design would:**  
- Reduce the number of comparisons per plot.  
- Use consistent symbols.  
- Move labels to a legend.  
- Highlight the reference line.  

This would make the main story—about winners, losers, and economic perceptions—much easier to see.

# Review: *The Next Industrial Revolution is Industrial AI*

I listened to the *DataFramed* episode with **Barbara Humpton (Siemens USA)** and **Olympia Brikis (Director of Industrial AI, Siemens USA)**.

## Reflections

-   **AI is not just about replacing workers; it’s about empowering them with better tools.**
-   **Collaborative AI** means machines handle repetitive tasks while humans focus on higher-value work.
-   Many panic about job loss, but the real challenge is learning AI’s **rudiments** and embracing its advantages.

## Key Lessons

1.  Empowerment, not replacement.\
2.  Collaboration between humans and machines.\
3.  Overcoming fear of AI through adaptation.\
4.  Trust and transparency for adoption.

## Conclusion

Industrial AI represents transformation, not displacement.\
The future of work is **collaboration where both humans and machines thrive**.
