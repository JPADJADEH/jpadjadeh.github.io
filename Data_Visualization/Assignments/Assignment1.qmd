## 1. Analyzing Anscombe’s Plots

Anscombe’s Quartet teaches us that data can look the same in numbers but tell very different stories when you make a graph. All four datasets have the same averages, correlations, and regression lines, but the plots show one is a straight line, another is curved, and others are shaped by outliers.

Lesson: If we only look at numbers, we may miss hidden patterns and draw wrong conclusions.

Always graph the data before and after running models. Simple plots like scatterplots can reveal issues such as:
- Outliers
- Non-linear trends
- Unusual points

### Anscombe Plots Code and Output

Here’s the code to generate the Anscombe Quartet plots.

```{r anscombe-plots, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Anscombe's Quartet"}
# Load data
data(anscombe)

# Create models
ff <- y ~ x
mods <- setNames(as.list(1:4), paste0("lm", 1:4))

for(i in 1:4) {
  ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
  mods[[i]] <- lmi <- lm(ff, data = anscombe)
}

# Prepare plot layout
op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = 0.1 + c(4,4,1,1), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))

# Plot each dataset
for(i in 1:4) {
  ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
  plot(ff, data = anscombe, col = "red", pch = 21, bg = "orange", cex = 1.2,
       xlim = c(3, 19), ylim = c(3, 13))
  abline(mods[[i]], col = "blue")
}
mtext("Anscombe's 4 Regression Data Sets", outer = TRUE, cex = 1.5)
par(op)
