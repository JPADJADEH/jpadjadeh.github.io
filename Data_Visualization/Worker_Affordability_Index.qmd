## Overview

The Worker Affordability Index is an interactive Shiny application that analyzes economic conditions across U.S. states. It combines three key economic indicators—minimum wage, unemployment rate, and cost of living—into a comprehensive affordability score.

## Live Dashboard

[**Open Worker Affordability Index Dashboard**](https://jpadjadeh.shinyapps.io/worker-affordability-index/)

## Features

### Dashboard 1: Economic Indicators

Explore individual economic metrics by state: - **Minimum Wage Map** - Current state minimum wage rates with rankings - **Unemployment Rate Map** - Job market conditions across states - **Cost of Living Index** - Regional affordability variations

### Dashboard 2: Overall Affordability

Composite score combining all three metrics into a 0-300 affordability scale, showing which states rank highest for worker economic well-being.

### Dashboard 3: Rankings

Flexible ranking system to view top or bottom performing states across: - Minimum wage levels - Job availability (unemployment) - Cost of living affordability - Overall affordability score

### Dashboard 4: Analytics

Detailed analysis tools including: - Federal economic trends (1975-2025) - Relationships between variables - State wage rankings - Regional comparisons - Affordability heatmaps

## Data

The application uses current 2025 state-level data for: - Minimum wage rates - Unemployment rates (Bureau of Labor Statistics) - Cost of living indices

All visualizations are built with ggplot2 and interactive Plotly charts for exploration.

## Technical Stack

-   **Framework:** Shiny (R)
-   **Visualization:** ggplot2, Plotly
-   **Geographic Data:** tigris, sf
-   **Deployment:** ShinyApps.io

## How to Use

1.  Click the button above to open the live dashboard
2.  Navigate between dashboards using the tabs at the top
3.  Interact with maps and charts to explore state-level comparisons
4.  Use dropdown menus and sliders to filter and customize views

## Key Insights

The app reveals patterns in worker affordability: - States with high minimum wages don't always rank highest in affordability (cost of living varies significantly) - Regional differences show distinct economic profiles - Job market strength correlates with cost of living in some regions
